              At <strong>Furr Baby</strong>, we believe pets aren't just animals
              — they’re family. Born from the love and chaos of real-life pet
              parenting, our platform is designed to bridge the gap between pet
              owners and trusted veterinarians, while creating a warm,
              community-driven space to celebrate every tail wag, pawprint, and
              story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're browsing on the web or using our mobile app, Furr
              Baby is your digital pet partner — always by your side.
            </p>
